# ML_LinearRegression_RMSE
This is a sample of Linear Regression with  OneHotEncoder &amp; StandardScaler to find RMSE

At first you should download datasets and import to your drive and then run the code.

you can see all data on Heatmap; I use Pandas Profiling to visual the data clearly.

I put accuracy end of the code to see accuracy on validation data.
